1. Overview
The MapComponent is a React functional component that renders an OpenLayers map with various functionalities such as drawing points, lines, and polygons, geocoding, toggling fullscreen mode, zooming in/out, and calculating measurements.

2. Dependencies
OpenLayers: A JavaScript library for displaying map data in web browsers.
ol-geocoder: An OpenLayers plugin for geocoding functionality.
3. State Variables
isFullscreen: A boolean state variable to track whether the map is in fullscreen mode or not.
mapInstance: A state variable to hold the reference to the OpenLayers Map instance.
distance: A state variable to store the calculated measurement.
4. Effect Hook: Map Initialization
Initializes the OpenLayers Map instance and sets up layers, view, geocoding functionality, and draw interactions.
Cleans up by removing the map target when the component unmounts.
5. Geocoder Configuration
Configures the geocoder plugin for searching places on the map.
6. Draw Interaction Configuration
Sets up draw interactions for drawing points, lines, and polygons on the map.
7. Function: toggleFullscreen
Toggles the fullscreen mode of the map by adding/removing a CSS class to the map container.
8. Function: handleZoomIn
Zooms in on the map when called.
9. Function: handleZoomOut
Zooms out on the map when called.
10. Function: calculateMeasurement
Calculates the total measurement (area for polygons, length for lines) of drawn features on the map.
Updates the distance state variable with the calculated measurement.
Displays the measurement in a popup message.
11. Render Method
Renders the map container, fullscreen button, zoom buttons, measurement display, and calculate measurement button.
This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the MapComponent and its functionalities, making it easier for developers to understand and work with the code.
